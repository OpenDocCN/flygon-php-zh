  zh: 前言
- en: I have been programming professionally in one capacity or another for over 30
    years. I continue to find it a challenging and rewarding career. I still learn
    new lessons about my profession every day, as I think is the case for every programmer
    dedicated to this craft.

  zh: 我已经以各种身份专业编程超过30年。我仍然觉得这是一个具有挑战性和有益的职业。我每天都在学习关于我的职业的新课程，我认为对于每个致力于这项工艺的程序员来说都是如此。
- en: Even more challenging and rewarding is helping other programmers to learn what
    I have learned. I have worked with PHP for 15 years now, in many different kinds
    of organizations and in every capacity from junior developer to VP of Engineering.
    In that time, I have learned a lot about the commonalities in legacy PHP applications.
    This book is distilled from my notes and memories from modernizing those codebases.
    I hope it can serve as a path for other programmers to follow, leading them out
    of a morass of bad code and bad work situations, and into a better life for themselves.

  zh: 更具挑战性和有益的是帮助其他程序员学习我所学到的东西。我现在已经用PHP工作了15年，在许多不同类型的组织中担任过各种职务，从初级开发人员到工程副总裁。在这段时间里，我对遗留PHP应用程序的共同点有了很多了解。这本书是从我现代化这些代码库的笔记和记忆中提炼出来的。我希望它能成为其他程序员的指引，带领他们走出糟糕的代码和工作环境的泥沼，走向更好的生活。
- en: This book also serves as penance for all of the legacy code I have left behind
    for others to deal with. All I can say is that I didn't know then what I know
    now. In part, I offer this book as atonement for the coding sins of my past. I
    hope it can help you to avoid my previous mistakes.

  zh: 这本书也是我为了弥补我留下的遗留代码而写的。我只能说，当时我不知道现在我知道的东西。部分原因，我写这本书是为了赎罪我过去的编码罪过。我希望它能帮助你避免我的以前的错误。
