- en: Games have the potential to bring about phenomenal changes in an individual.
    Games have been used historically to improve skills, and in some cases develop
    new skills. The most visible example of gamification can be of the armed forces
    the world over, who conduct "war-games" to help soldiers experience the war environment
    and use their training skills to achieve the results. These games help them use
    and develop their skills. Although gamification methods need to be used cautiously,
    the advantages outweigh the cautions if the gamified process is implemented smartly.

  zh: 游戏化到底是什么？
- en: '**Gamification** is the use of strategies and techniques used by game designers,
    in situations other than games to get people to treat those situations more like
    a game. People confuse serious games, game theory, video game design, and gamification
    as one and the same. These could be things such as fun, rules, competition, points,
    and so on, and then applying them to non-game situations.'

  zh: '**游戏化**是游戏设计师在游戏之外的情境中使用的策略和技术，让人们更像玩游戏一样对待这些情境。人们将严肃游戏、博弈论、视频游戏设计和游戏化混为一谈。这些可能是一些有趣、规则、竞争、积分等，然后将它们应用到非游戏情境中。'
- en: Gamification differs from serious games. Serious games are considered games,
    but they are not designed for the purpose of having fun. They are for more practical
    uses. Flight simulators, for example, have all the mechanics, technologies, and
    design processes found in a flight video game. Developers, however, create the
    video game for entertainment purposes, while the flight simulator has a more serious
    purpose.

  zh: 游戏化与严肃游戏不同。严肃游戏被认为是游戏，但它们并非旨在带来乐趣。它们用于更实际的用途。例如，飞行模拟器具有飞行视频游戏中的所有机械、技术和设计过程。然而，开发者创建视频游戏是为了娱乐目的，而飞行模拟器具有更严肃的目的。

    which takes "Game-Like" thinking into consideration when making a decision.

  zh: 另一方面，博弈论仅仅是研究战略决策的学科，它在做决策时考虑了“类似游戏”的思维。
- en: Gamification pertains to the structure and design process applied in good game
    design, whether it is a video game, board game, or a serious game. Gamification
    is simply a set of tools and materials used in game design, which also applies
    to jobs other than creating a game.

- en: If we were to think about what a school is, we would quickly conclude that school
    itself is a game. It has all the classic game elements built into our traditional
    school system already. In almost every type of learning environment, you will
    find the idea of a reward system. This reward system could be in the form of grades
    or grade point average. Schools reward those with good performance with higher
    grades as opposed to someone who does not perform as well.

  zh: 如果我们考虑学校是什么，我们很快就会得出结论，学校本身就是一个游戏。我们传统的学校系统中已经内置了所有经典的游戏元素。在几乎每种学习环境中，你都会发现奖励制度的概念。这种奖励制度可以以成绩或平均成绩的形式存在。学校奖励表现良好的人高分，而不是表现不佳的人。
- en: Schools also have a penalty system in place. If a learner doesn't perform to
    a certain standard, the school penalizes him/her. It holds him/her back, ostracizes
    him/her, and in some cases removes him/her from the community. School is probably
    the most widely played game in the world. Unfortunately, most of the people don't
    see much fun in school today. Hence, the idea of school as a game is virtually
    nonexistent. You can expect this change, however, over the coming decades as we
    make our learning environments more engaging.

    San Diego. Software developer Broderbund Software published it in 1985\. It was
    a huge success. This game teaches geography and history to players as they act
    like detectives, with the ACME Detective Agency looking for a former ACME Detective
    Carmen SanDiego. It's received over 70 awards, in particular the Silver Apple

- en: In a traditional college-level course, your grade is based primarily on your
    scores from a few exams. A student starts with a 100 percent grade, and throughout
    the semester loses points until he/she settles with a final grade. Graham set
    up a system where students could earn points for different types of achievements.
    According to Graham, "I wanted students to have more opportunities to practice
    the craft of being a historian, beyond the formal assessments of the classroom."
    These achievements ranged from exam grades to participation in class. Students
    could get point achievements, such as doing outside research to visiting the professor.
    Some of the game challenges included transcribing lines of ancient papyrus, learning
    the rhetoric embedded in computer code, completing tutorials on logical fallacies,
    learning some Latin, and participating in online crowdsourcing history projects
    A student's grade was based on his/her level of achievements rather than on his/her
    exam grades only. More importantly, the system was voluntary, so one student's
    path to an A grade could be very different from another student's path to the
    same grade. Although voluntary, Graham saw about a 40 percent participation rate,
